								<h2>How I got into tech</h2>
								<p>I wrote my first "program" in seventh grade math class: a set of instructions to move a mouse cursor along a computer screen so that it drew various shapes (we were learning about angles).</p>
								<p>But my first problem-solving and logic "training", if you could call it that, was in elementary school.  I was an oddball: I knew how to read before I started kindergarten.  So in the first grade, while my peers were learning how to read, they had me sit in a room by myself with a printed stack of brain teaser puzzles.  They were usually patten matching puzzles, or the kind where you draw a line connecting all the dots on the page without crossing a line.  That sort of thing.  There was no grade involved, no teacher to verify that I either did or didn't solve the puzzle (I knew I always did).  There were probably at least twenty pages in that puzzle stack and I didn't know how many I was supposed to solve per day, etc.  This resulted in a dislike for doing brain teasers just for the sake of doing them.  The only thing that part of my life brought me was the dubious "honor" of skipping second grade.</p>
								<p>So returning back to seventh grade, I found myself in the exact same situation.  I'd finish math early and end up doing "extra credit" assignments, which were, you guessed it, more brain teasers.  I got a gold star on the calendar for each day that I solved the brain teaser.</p>
								<p>In college, my degree had a couple of "specializations" (not minors).  One was business, the other was math.  I chose the business one because I was more interested in how people use technology in their daily lives.  The math speciality was more geared to compiler writing, systems, and graphics.  I didn't find those as interesting at the time, plus it scared me, to be honest, that I could write the software that people's lives depended on.  I could imagine the amount of stress involved in programmning airplane navigation or hospital laser treatment machines.  At least in business, the most you can do is lose money, not lives.</p>
								<p>Fast-forward to the present.  I'm a software engineer, having earned a B.S. in Computing and Information Sciences.  I have enough years of experience to be considered "mid" or "senior".  How did I break into tech, then?  I went the CS degree route.  I did an internship my sophomore year and worked at the university's help desk my junior and senior years.  I signed up for on-campus interviews my senior year, and I had accepted a job offer before finals.  The job offer was for a 6-week paid bootcamp at the job site, with a final project.  If your final project passed, you would move into a permanent (associate) role.  I'm pretty sure everyone in that bootcamp passed; it wasn't a very hard project. Et voil√†!</p>
								<p>I've gone my entire career without having to solve a single "Leetcode" problem!  In fact it was only last year (2023) when I even heard of Leetcode.  I hear that it's required a lot especially in today's job market.  So, back to brainteasers all over again, whereas most if not all the code I've written has been to solve a specific business problems.
